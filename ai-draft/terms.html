    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>AI-Draft: AI Assistant for Word</strong> (the “Add-in”). By installing or using this Add-in,
      you agree to the following Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, please uninstall the Add-in
      and stop using it immediately.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        AI-Draft is an AI-powered writing assistant for Microsoft Word. The Add-in allows you to generate, rewrite,
        summarize, and translate text by using <strong>your own API keys (“BYOK”)</strong> for services such as
        OpenAI GPT and Google Gemini.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI-Draft does <strong>not</strong> provide its own AI model and does not access or manage your accounts with
        any third-party AI providers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)</h2>
      <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Obtaining and managing your own API keys</li>
        <li>Complying with the terms and policies of OpenAI, Google, or other model providers</li>
        <li>All costs associated with your API usage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Add-in does <strong>not</strong> store your API keys on any external server operated by us.
        Your keys are stored locally using Microsoft Office/Office.js settings on your device or within your
        Microsoft 365 environment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Data Handling and Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        AI-Draft does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any Word document content to servers controlled
        by RootBro Software Studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use AI features, your selected text and prompts are sent <strong>only</strong> to the AI model
        endpoint you have configured via your own API key. We do not receive, store, or log your prompts,
        responses, or document contents.
      </p>
